      <p>The <a
      href="http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Committers"
      >Roles and Responsibilities</a> document describes the general role of a
      committer on an incubating project. This page provides links to
      more information to help new committers get started.</p>
    <section id="Mailing+Lists">
      <title>Mailing Lists</title>
      <p>Everything -- but <em>everything</em>-- inside the Apache world
      occurs or is reflected in email. As some people say, 'If it isn't
      in my email, it didn't happen.' Decisions only get made on public
      Apache mail lists -- not anywhere off list, such as IRC, IM, or private 
      emails.</p>
      <p> Each project has a set of lists, which are typically called
      <em>project</em>-dev, <em>project</em>-user, and
      <em>project</em>-commits. A few <a
      href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html"
      >Apache-wide lists</a> cross all boundaries, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>committers</strong>: sends important messages to all
          Apache committers; it's not used for discussions;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>community</strong>: where all Apache committers can
          discuss things that are about Apache;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>infrastructure</strong>: where the roots and the
          infrastructure team discuss and work on the Apache
          infrastructure needs;
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>legal-discuss</strong>: where Apache committers can
          ask questions that have a legal aspect;
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>repository</strong>: discussions about the Apache
          artifact repository;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>party</strong>: where people plan how to have fun. :-)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Action items for committers include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Become familiar with Apache developer <a
          href="http://www.apache.org/dev/contrib-email-tips.html">Tips
          for email contributors</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Subscribe to the -user, -dev, and -commits lists for your
          project.</li>
          <li>Become aware of what else is going on in the Incubator by
          subscribing to the Incubator's general list.</li>
          <li>Become aware of what else is going on at the ASF by subscribing to the
            <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html#foundation-community"
            >community</a>, <a
            href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html#foundation-infrastructure"
            >infrastructure</a>, and <a
            href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html#foundation-legal"
            >legal-discuss</a> Apache-wide lists.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Apache also has private lists. For example, your project will
        probably have a private mail list named <em>project</em>-private, 
        which your Podling PMC will use for sensitive discussions. Never 
        mix public and private mail lists in the same post -- see the 
        section titled <a
        href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#
        management">Balancing confidentiality and public discussion</a>
        in <a
        href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html">How it
        Works</a>. For example, never include both your dev and private
        lists in the same post. Posting to the dev list is sufficient
        because each member of your Podling PMC will also be on that
        list. </p>

            scenes.</p>
            <p>Be proactive about responding to infrastructure issues on
            your project mailing lists. Does the web server seem to be
            down? Is Jira or Subversion down? Check the <a
            href="http://www.apache.org/dev/#status">status of servers</a>
            and explain the reason to your project lists (as you can
            see, no need to alert the ASF infrastructure people).</p>
