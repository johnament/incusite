                <title>What goes into a release</title>
                <p>
                    A podling should begin to familiarize itself with ASF policies for releases.  Those policies can be found at <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/#releases">http://www.apache.org/dev/#releases</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is well understood that one of the goals of incubation is to help a podling understand how to
                    build <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/#releases">ASF compliant releases</a>. This is why its
                    mandatory to have at least 3 +1 votes from
                    <a href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Incubator+Project+Management+Committee+%28PMC%29">IPMC members</a>
                    review the releases (this should include your <a href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Mentor">mentors</a> but is not mandatory)
                    for accuracy in compliance with the ASF and <a href="&root-path;/incubation/Incubation_Policy.html#Releases">Incubator policies</a>.
                    The podling community, of course, needs to be fully engaged in review process as well. Anybody reviewing
                    the releases will provide the release manager and IPMC members with information about what is wrong
                    with the release. The severity of the issues and whether they are blocking or not may be discussed
                    but the ultimate guidance on where podling releases may get additional flexibility belongs to the mentors and IPMC members.
                </p>

                <title>Podling Constraints</title>
                <p>
                    The <a href="&root-path;/incubation/Incubation_Policy.html#Releases">Incubator policies</a> apply two additional constraints to podlings for their releases.  They are repeated here for clarity only.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Release artifacts must include <em>incubating</em> in the final file name</li>
                        <li>Release artifacts must include a <a href="&root-path;/guides/branding.html#disclaimers">disclaimer</a> within the release artifact(s) as noted</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order for a podling to receive full permission from the IPMC to execute the release, the release
                    vote must be held on the <a href="&root-path;/guides/lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org">incubator general list</a>
                    and pass based on the <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/voting.html#ReleaseVotes">standard Package Release voting rules</a>.
                    Only Incubator PMC votes are binding, but all are encouraged to vote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Incubator PMC expects the source releases to be staged on
                    <em>https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/$podlingName</em> so that they can easily be moved
                    to the release location via <em>svn mv</em>.

                <p>
                    Podlings may create Eclipse Update Sites to publish artifacts that are consumed as Eclipse Plugins.  For details, please review <a href="releasing-eclipse-update-site.html">Releasing Eclipse Update Sites</a>
