            <title>What is Graduation?</title>
            <p>
                Graduation is the act of a podling becoming either a
                subproject under an already existing Apache project, or
                becoming a top level Apache project. Graduating is a
                democratic process: in the end, it comes down to a <code><a 
                href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html'>VOTE</a></code>. Note
                that during your stay in the incubator, you are already busy
                with the process of Graduating: by adopting Apache procedures,
                growing and fostering your community, having (civil) fights
                concerning code style (tabs versus spaces), cutting releases
                and so forth. All these acts have an influence on your
                projects graduation.

            </p>
            <p>

                The road to graduation is pretty clear: depending on whether your
                project wants to become a top level project, or join as a
                subproject under an already existing project the steps are
                fairly simple but do take time and effort. This document
                provides guidelines for making this process run smooth.

                <title>Whether to Graduate to Subproject or to Top Level Project</title>
                <p>
                    Each proposal has a <a
                    href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Sponsor">Sponsor</a>.
                    The identity of the Sponsor indicates the natural
                    destination. For proposals sponsored by the <a 
                    href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#board">Board</a> or by
                    the <a
                    href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Incubator+Project+Management+Committee+%28PMC%29">Incubator
                    PMC (IPMC)</a>, this is a top level project. For others,
                    this is as a subproject of the sponsoring project. However, the
                    destination is fixed only on graduation, not entry. Projects
                    grow and evolve during the graduation process. As
                    graduation approaches, this original preference should be
                    reviewed based on where the project is now.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Graduation as a subproject is only possible if the
                    subproject still falls within the scope of the project and
                    requires the consent of the project <a
                    href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#structure'>PMC</a>.
                    Graduation as a project requires the formation of the new
                    project by the <a href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#board">Board</a>.

                </p>

                    The <a

                    will also express a democratic opinion. For those seeking
                    to graduate to a subproject this <code><a 
                    href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html'>VOTE</a></code> 
                    is to approve the
                    transfer. For those seeking to graduation as a top level
                    project, this will be a recommendation to the <a 
                    href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#board">Board</a>.
                    Expect IPMC-ers to ask questions about the project
                    including about the choice of destination. This is part of
                    the normal process.

                Before you start thinking about graduation, you need to make 
                sure you are ready and meet the requirements imposed on Apache projects.
                This section will provide a shortlist for podlings to

                    Projects need to cut releases. Apache projects need to
                    understand how to cut Apache releases. Therefore it is an
                    important step during your stay in the incubator to
                    demonstrate the ability to create an Apache Release.

                </p>
                <p>

                    Podlings do not need to actually <em>publish</em> a
                    release to demonstrate that they understand how to
                    accomplish such a feat. However, creating a release that
                    is approved by the <a
                    href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Incubator+Project+Management+Committee+%28PMC%29">
                    incubator project management committee</a> is usually the
                    simplest way to do this.

                </p>
                <p>

                    If you are going to cut a release (which is highly
                    recommended), then please read the <a
                    href="releasemanagement.html">Incubator Release Management

                    release that will get approved by the <a

                <title>Creating an Open and Diverse community</title>
                <p>

                    A major criterion for graduation is to have developed an
                    open and diverse <a
                    href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#Meritocracy">meritocratic</a>
                    community. Time has demonstrated that these kinds of
                    communities are more robust and productive than more
                    closed ones.

                </p>
                <p>

                    Apache projects are self-sustaining and self-governing
                    communities. Long term success and health requires that
                    these communities understand how to:

                    community for your podling in the <a

                    As a project grows, it needs to renew itself by accepting
                    new committers. A project needs to learn how it can
                    recruit new developers and committers into the community.
                    Accepting new committers usually increases the diversity
                    of the project. So, this process is very beneficial. <a
                    href="community.html">Community building</a> requires
                    energy which could have been spent on code development but
                    this cost is an important investment for the future of the
                    project.

                </p>
                <p>

                    The openness of the community is not only measured by the
                    number of contributors. Open and respectful discussions on
                    the mailing lists are vital. Ways to resolve technical
                    conflict without destroying personal relationships must be
                    learned. Learning to use mailing lists effectively is very
                    important. If this can be achieved, then you have shown to
                    be a lively, active and successful community. The future
                    looks bright.

                </p>
                <p>

                    The project is considered to have a diverse community when
                    it is not highly dependent on any single contributor
                    (there are at least 3 legally independent committers and
                    there is no single company or entity that is vital to the
                    success of the project). Basically this means that when a
                    project mostly consists of contributors from one company,
                    this is a sign of not being diverse enough. You can
                    mitigate this requirement by admitting more external
                    contributors to your project that have no tie to the
                    single entity.

                <title>Graduating to a Top Level Project</title>

                <p>

                    Top level projects are created by the <a 
                    href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#board">Board</a>. The <a
                    href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Incubator+Project+Management+Committee+%28PMC%29">Incubator
                    Project Management Committee (IPMC)</a> can therefore only
                    recommend to the Board that the project is ready to
                    graduate to a top level project.

                </p>
                <p>

                    Graduation to a top level project requires:

                    <ul>
                        <li>a charter for your project</li>
                        <li>a positive community graduation <code><a 
                        href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html'>VOTE</a></code></li>
                        <li>a positive IPMC recommendation <code><a 
                        href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html'>VOTE</a></code></li>
                        <li>the acceptance of the <a href='#tlp-resolution'>resolution</a> by the Board</li>
                    </ul>

                    This process can take a while, since it typically sparks
                    some discussion inside the community and possibly in the
                    IPMC.

                </p>
                <p>

                    Here's an estimated timeline for the graduation process.
                    It should help you understand when you should start
                    ramping up your community to get timely graduation and
                    make the process smooth.

                    For each event we scheduled one or two weeks. Even though
                    a <code><a 
                    href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html'>VOTE</a></code> 
                    is usually limited to 72 hours, you should prepare
                    for discussion and possibly having to cast a revote with a
                    revised proposal.

                </p>

                <section id='tlp-community-vote'>
                    <title>Community Graduation Vote</title>

                    <p>

                        A community needs to be willing to govern itself
                        before it can become a top level project. A good way
                        to demonstrate this is through a free <code><a 
                        href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html'>VOTE</a></code> (by the
                        community) on the graduation proposal.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        This <code>VOTE</code> is not a requirement but is recommended. It
                        is unlikely that <a
                        href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Incubator+Project+Management+Committee+%28PMC%29">IPMC</a>
                        members will vote to approve graduation unless the <a
                        href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Mentor">Mentors</a>
                        and community positively express their readiness for
                        graduation. It is wise to notify the <a
                        href='lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org'>incubator
                        general list</a> that the community vote is starting. Please do not Cc the
                        vote to the general list as that creates confusion, instead you can either:
                        <ul>
                            <li> FWD the [VOTE] e-mail to the general list, or </li>
                            <li> Send a different copy to the general list indicating that a graduation community [VOTE] is in progress </li>
                        </ul>

                        So, in this case a suitable <a 
                        href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#board">Board</a> resolution should be
                        drawn up by the community advised by the

                        Committers can access the podling template for
                        resolutions in the <a

                        The original proposal and the status document should
                        be consulted when creating this document. Projects
                        evolve over time and some deviation from the original
                        proposal may well prove acceptable. The <a 
                        href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#board">Board</a>
                        resolution is the ultimate definition of the scope of
                        an Apache project. So, it is important that it
                        reflects the vision for the project as it appears on
                        the eve of graduation.

                    <p>

                        A good resolution is neither too narrow nor too broad.
                        If the project's scope is too narrow, then its
                        activities will be unnecessarily constrained. If a
                        project's scope is too broad then it may lack focus
                        and suffer from governance issues.

                        A community needs to be willing to govern itself
                        before it can become a top level project. A good way
                        to demonstrate this is through a free 
                        <code><a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html'>VOTE</a></code>
                        (by the community) on the graduation proposal.

                    <p>

                        This <code>VOTE</code> is not a requirement but is recommended. It
                        is unlikely that <a

                        and community positively express their readiness for
                        graduation. When this vote starts, you should notify the Incubator and the Sponsor. Please do not Cc the
                        vote to these lists as that creates confusion, instead you can either:

                        When graduating to a new project, the process is more
                        complex. Creating a new project requires a <a
                        href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/board/calendar.html'>resolution</a>
                        to be passed by the <a
                        href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/board/'>Board</a>.
                        Usually once this happens, members of the Board will
                        inform the appropriate chairs and <a
                        href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#structure'>PMCs</a>.
                        Occasionally, this will be missed: if more than 72
                        hours has passed since the Board meeting, it may be
                        worth someone posting a polite reminder to their
                        favorite director.

                        The

                        of the Apache Software Foundation. This allows them

                    Graduation is the first step in what is hopefully a long road.
                    There are some issues which incubation may not cover.

                    <p>

                        When a project graduates, then the infrastructure
                        resources (mailing lists, websites, source, etc.) need to
                        be transferred from the Incubator to a project's new home.

            <title>Final Revision of Podling Incubation Records</title>
            <p>
              When a project has finished its graduation steps, then the incubator resources
              need to be updated to indicate that the project is no
              longer incubating. Here are a few of the items that need
              to be done:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Update the svn
                <code>incubator/trunk/content/projects/${project}.xml</code>
                file to show the project's status.
              </li>
              <li>
                Update the podling summary metadata file,
                i.e. <code>incubator/trunk/content/podlings.xml</code> svn file.
                See the content/podlings.dtd and follow examples of other recent graduates.
                At the beginning of the process, add the "graduating" element.
                When finished the graduation process, then:
                Change the podling status to "graduated"; 
                add the "enddate" attribute to document when the project graduated;
                add the "resolution" element (see other project examples);
                remove the "graduating" element.
              </li>
              <li>
                After your project has finished reporting to the Incubator, then
                remove the "reporting" element from that <code>podlings.xml</code> file.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ensure that other svn resources for your project have moved to
                your new home.
              </li>
              <li>
                Review this whole graduation guide.
              </li>
              <li>
                NOTE: Please edit this guide to add missing steps and clarifications.

                    responsibility for its own oversight.

                  <p>
                    A project needs to ensure that its code base is
                    clean from an IP perspective. New committers need to
                    recruited, educated and mentored. Quality releases
                    need to be cut. Community spirit needs to be maintained
                    and conflicts resolved positively. Board reports need
                    to be accurate and prompt.

                    Help is still available but the
                    appropriate bodies (infrastructure, community, legal
                    and so on) should now be approached directly.

                  <p>

                    Each project needs to be able to manage security issues
                    discovered in their code. By their nature, these issues 
                    need to be dealt with in private. These issues may either 
                    be dealt with on a separate security list or on the 
                    private list. Which list is suitable for security issues 
                    should be noted.

                  </p>
                  <p>

                    Volunteers need to be found from the
                    <a
                      href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#structure'>
                      PMC
                    </a>
                    to work with the Apache security team and act as
                    first contacts on security matters. The new project 
                    should make contact with the team soon after graduation
                    and not wait for the first issue to be raised.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                  
                    Projects should adopt a positive attitude towards
                    security issues. It is easy to gain a poor reputation
                    by mishandling of these issues. There are many people
                    at Apache with considerable experience in this area
                    so ask first.

                   Passing through the incubation process gives a very 
                   valuable perspective. Please help to improve the process 
                   by guiding new podlings and by developing improved policy
                   and documentation on the <a
