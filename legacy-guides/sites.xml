                Podlings need to build a community in Apache in order to be accepted
                as part of the Apache Software Foundation. One of the tools used to build
                a community is the web site.

            <title>Podling Website Requirements</title>
            <p>
                Podlings are, by definition, not yet fully accepted as part of the
                Apache Software Foundation. Therefore, they are subject to additional
                constraints on their websites. These policies MUST be adhered to
                before Graduation is considered unless prior approval is obtained from
                the Incubator PMC.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The published site for each podling must conform to the guidelines in
                    <a href="&root-path;/guides/branding.html">Podling Branding/Publicity</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The sources for every podling site sources should be maintained in the podling's site SVN or git
                    directory
                </li>
                <li>
                    The published site for each podling should conform to this URL space:
                    <code>http://podlingname.incubator.apache.org/</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The staging site (if using CMS) for each podling should conform to this URL space:
                    <code>http://podlingname.staging.apache.org/</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every podling should maintain an incubation status file under:
                    <code>http://incubator.apache.org/projects/podlingname.html</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Eventual extra incubation documents should be filed under:
                    <code>http://incubator.apache.org/projects/podlingname/**</code>
                </li>
            </ul>

                <title>Creating A Good Podling Site</title>
                <p>
                    Apache Project Web Sites typically include several standard pages.
                    Each page is formatted with a navigation bar on the left and a project
                    standard header that includes the Incubator graphic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Web Site can be established during incubation, and migrated
                    after incubation to a permanent place in the TLP home.

            <section id="Tool">
                <title>Web Site Generation Tool</title>
                <p>
                    The choice of tool used to generate the web site is left to
                    the podling. If you already have a tool that you are comfortable
                    with, you can continue to use it. If you do not, consider using
                    the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/cmsref.html">Apache CMS</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regardless of which tool you use, the web site should be maintained
                    in the svn repository, and include the site generation tool as a binary
                    file. This simplifies the process of site generation and enables changes
                    to the site to be made by any committer. The generated site should also
                    be checked into svn. This allows the generated site to be relocated
                    to any part of the Apache site after incubation is complete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the site is independent of the code, it should exist high in
                    the svn repository, e.g. parallel to the trunk of the source tree.

                <title>Using A Wiki To Create Documentation</title>
                <p>
                    Podlings may use a wiki to create documentation (including the website) providing that follow the
                    <a href='http://cwiki.apache.org/'>guidelines</a>. In particular, care must be taken to
                    ensure that access to the wiki used to create documentation that may be included in the project
                    release is restricted to only those with filed <a href='http://www.apache.org/licenses/'>individual
                    CLAs</a>. The PPMC MUST review all changes and ensure that
                    trust is not abused.
