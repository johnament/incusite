            <section id="Making+the+Board+Report">
                <title>Board Report</title>
                <p>
                    The Incubator <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/board/reporting">reports</a> monthly to the Apache <a
                        href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/board">Board of Directors</a>.  The report itself is the collaborative effort of
                    many Incubator contributors, but the Chair is ultimately responsible for ensuring that it is filed.  </p>

                <p>
                    The Board appreciates receiving the IPMC report:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>on time</li>
                    <li>in a consistent format</li>
                    <li>with an accurate summary of the state of the reporting podlings</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The "runbook" for managing the preparation of the report is implemented as a script which prints out documentation,
                    instructions, literal commands, due dates, etc:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/public/trunk/report_runbook.py">report_runbook.py</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Many of the tasks documented in the runbook may be attended to by either the Chair or a designee such as a "Report
                    Manager", but it's the Chair who is accountable for overseeing the process.
                </p>
