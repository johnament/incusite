This document is descriptive, not normative. It describes approaches to
drawing up a proposal for submission. It is not an inflexible standard but
represents a consensus condensed from discussions on the
<a href='lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org'>general mailing list</a>.

          <p>
<a href='entry.html'>Entry</a> to the incubator is a democratic 
<a href="&root-path;/incubation/Process_Description">process</a> decided by a vote. 
The proposal is the document upon which the 
<a href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Sponsor">Sponsor</a> votes. 
So, though it's neither necessary nor sufficient to have a good proposal,
a good proposal increases the chances of a positive result.
           </p>
           <p>
Proposals to the incubator generate attention. The 
<a href='lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org'>general mailing list</a> is open,
widely discussed and well indexed. It is a very public space.
The proposal is a manifesto. 
A good proposal should target also the wider audience and not just the
<a href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Incubator+Project+Management+Committee+%28PMC%29">
jury</a>.
Use this time to engage and inform potential 
<a href='participation.html#developer'>developers</a> 
and <a href='participation.html#user'>users</a>. 
           </p>
			<p>
Much of the information will be reused in the 
<a href='sites.html'>Podling website</a>. 
A good proposal should shape the future evolution of the project 
but each proposal captures only the particular instant at birth. 
It is understood that projects change and evolve. 
           </p>

        <section id='note-on-improvements'><title>Continuous Improvement</title>
        	<p>
The <a href="&root-path;/incubation/Process_Description.html">Incubation process</a> is continuously evolving. 
Hopefully this will help newer projects to be even stronger and more successful then existing ones. 
One consequence of this approach is that precedence is not always a reliable guide.
Another is that documentation may be a little outdated.

        <section id='preparation'><title>Preparation</title>
      <p>
Start with research. The <a href='entry.html'>incubator entry guide</a> is a good place to start. 
Read the <a href='http://www.apache.org'>Apache</a> 
<a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation'>documentation</a>.
       </p>
       <p>
<a href='lists.html'>Subscribe</a> to the 
<a href='lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org'>general mailing list</a>. 
Spend some time reviewing the 
<a href='http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/'>mailing lists archives</a>. 
The mailing lists are the canonical form of 
<a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#communication'>communication</a> 
and <a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#decision-making'>decision making</a> 
at Apache. Documentation is an attempt to codify the consensus formed and record the decisions taken on list.
       </p>
       <p>
Before starting on the formal proposal, recruit a 
<a href="&root-path;/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Champion">Champion</a>. The Champion understands 
Apache and should be able to help navigate the process.
       </p>
       <p>
Review <a href='http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/'>recent proposals</a> and how they have been 
<a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/">received</a>.
       </p>
       <p>
The incoming community needs to work together before presenting this
proposal to the incubator. Think about and discuss future goals and the reasons for coming to Apache.
Feel free to ask questions <a href='lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org'>on list</a>.
       </p>
       <p>
Every proposal is different. There will always be some aspects which do not seem
to fit well into the <a href='#proposal-template'>template</a>. 
Use the template as a guide but do not feel constrained
by it. Adopt what works and change what doesn't. That's fine - in fact, it's expected. 
       </p>
       <p>
Be sure to add your proposal to <a href='http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/ProjectProposals'>this list</a>.
       </p>
    </section>   
       <section id='name'><title>Project Name</title>
         <p>
           While it is important to ensure a
           <a href="graduation.html#notes-names">suitable project name</a>
           and product names sometime during incubation, it is not necessary
           to do this prior to entering incubation. In fact, be careful not to
           disrupt your proposal and entry process.
         </p>
       </section>   
       <section id='presentation'><title>Presentation</title>
            <p>
Once the preparatory work is done, the proposal should be presented to the
incubator.  Post the proposal in plain text in an email to the 
<a href='lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org'>mailing list</a> 
whose subject is prefixed with <code>[PROPOSAL]</code>.  You should be clear 
that you want to discuss your proposal when submitting this mail.
        </p>
            <p>
If there is interest in the proposal, expect a lively debate to begin. 
Approval is an open and 
<a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html'>democratic</a> 
<a href='entry.html#understanding'>process</a>.
Discussion is an important part of opinion formation. A proposal
will require development if it is to gain the maximum level of support from the
<a href="&root-path;/whoweare.html">electorate</a>.
        </p>
    </section>
        <section id='developing'><title>Developing The Proposal</title>
            <p>
Expect to work on improving the proposal on the list after presenting it. 
No preparation can cover every question. It is usual for unexpected 
and novel questions to be asked. This is often a sign of interest. So 
(though it may sometimes feel like an ordeal) 
approach these questions as a positive opportunity.
			</p>
			<p>
The <a href='http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/'>wiki</a> is a good 
development tool. Consider creating a wiki page containing the evolving proposal 
content. Those who are interested should add themselves 
to the watch list for the page so they can receive change notifications.
       </p>
            <p>
Developing the proposal on the wiki allows easy collaboration. This has disadvantages
as well as advantages. The wiki is just a tool to assist the easy development of the 
final proposal (the one that will be voted upon). Not every change improves a proposal
and there is no requirement that every change is accepted by the proposers. Note that the incubator 
asks all participants to abide by appropriate <a href='participation.html'>netiquette</a>.
        </p>
            <p>
Effective management of this development is an exercise in community building. 
The wiki is not an appropriate forum for debating changes. Discussion should be
gently moved onto the appropriate 
<a href='lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org'>mailing list</a>. 
        </p>
    </section>
        <section id='vote'><title>The Vote</title>
            <p>
When the proposal seems finished and some sort of consensus has emerged, the
proposal should be put to a vote.

If the wiki is used to develop the proposal, please ensure that the wiki
matches the final proposal then add a notice to the wiki that development of
the document is now complete:
        </p>
<source>
----
/!\ '''FINAL''' /!\ 

This proposal is now complete and has been submitted for a VOTE.
----
</source>
      <p>
Embed the final proposal text or a link to a specific revision number of the
wiki proposal page in the email which kicks off the VOTE thread.  If a change
is required after the vote has been called then the vote must be cancelled,
the change made, and the vote restarted.  Alternatively, Mentors will advise
on how to make the change once the proposal has been accepted if this is
appropriate.  Do not edit the wiki proposal unless you cancel the vote 
thread.
      </p>
    </section>
</section>
    <section id="proposal-template">
      <title>Proposal Template</title>
      <p>
The aim of presenting a template with examples and comments is educational.
Proposals are not required to adopt this format. 
Every proposal is different. There may be sections which don't seem to be
useful. It's fine to miss them out and to add new ones that the proposal seems
to need. Best practice evolves. Innovation is acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
The format is less important than the content. 
      </p>
      <p>
In the following sections:
      </p>
      <note>
      	<p>
Commentary is thus.
		</p>
      </note>
      <source>
Examples are thus.
      </source>
       <section id='template-abstract'><title>Abstract</title>
       <note>
<p>
A short descriptive summary of the
project. A short paragraph, ideally one sentence in length.
</p><p>
The abstract should be suitable for reuse in
the board resolution used to create the official project upon graduation,
as the first paragraph on the podling <a href='sites.html'>web site</a> 
and in the <a href='http://projects.apache.org/create.html'>DOAP</a> document.
</p>
	</note>
<source>
Examples:

  Geronimo will be a J2EE compliant container.
       
  Heraldry will develop technologies around the emerging user-centric 
  identity space.
           
  Yoko will be a CORBA server.
</source>
        </section>
        <section id='template-proposal'><title>Proposal</title>
        <note>
<p>
A lengthier description of the proposal. Should be reasonably declarative.
More discursive material should be included in the <a href='#template-rationale'>rationale</a>
(or other later sections).
</p>
		</note>
<source>
Example (XAP):
  XAP is to provide an XML-based declarative framework for building, 
  deploying and maintaining rich, interactive, Ajax-powered web 
  applications. A basic principal of XAP is to leverage existing Ajax
  ...
</source>
        </section>
        <section id='template-background'><title>Background</title>
        <note>
<p>
Provides context for those unfamiliar with the problem space and history. 
</p><p>
Explain terms whose meanings may be misunderstood  (for example, 
where there is not a single widely adopted definition).
<p>
</p>
This content should be capable of being safely ignored by domain experts.
It should probably find an eventual home on the Podling website.
</p>
		</note>
<source>
Example (Heraldry):
  To provide some background, the Higgins Project is being actively 
  developed within Eclipse and is a framework that will enable users
  and enterprises to integrate identity, profile, and relationship
  information across multiple systems. Using context providers, 
  existing and new systems such as directories, collaboration spaces
  ...
</source>
        </section>
        <section id='template-rationale'><title>Rationale</title>
        <note>
<p>
Explains why this project needs to exist and why should it be adopted by Apache.
This is the right place for discursive material.
</p>
		</note>
<source>
Example (Beehive):
  There is a strong need for a cohesive, easy-to-use programming model
  for building J2EE applications. Developers new to Java are forced to
  learn a myriad of APIs just to build simple applications; advanced 
  J2EE developers are forced to write tedious plumbing code; and tools
  authors are limited in what they can do to simplify the experience 
  due to the underlying complexity.
</source>
        </section>
        <section id='template-initial-goals'><title>Initial Goals</title>
        	<note>
<p>
A complex proposal (involving multiple existing code bases, for example)
may cause concerns about its practicality. A good way
to address these concerns is to create a plan that demonstrates the proposal
is feasible and has been carefully thought through.
</p>
<p>
Many projects will not need this section.
</p>
			</note>
<source>
Example (Heraldry):
  * Expansion of Yadis and OpenID libraries into additional languages 
    beyond the existing Python, Ruby, Perl, and PHP libraries
  * OpenID authentication specification revision to fix known security
    considerations, investigate compatibility with the DIX IETF 
    proposal, describe Yadis integration, and allow either an URL or 
    XRI be used as the End User's Identifier
    ...
</source>
        </section>
        <section id='template-current-status'><title>Current Status</title>
        	<note>
<p>
This section (and the contained topics) describes
the candidate's current status and development practices.
This should be an honest assessment balancing these against Apache's 
<a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/'>principles</a> and 
<a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#management'>development ideals</a>. 
</p><p>
For some proposals, this is a chance to demonstrate understanding 
of the issues that will need to addressed before graduation.
For others, this is a chance to highlight the close match with Apache that already exists.
Proposals without an initial code base should just simply state that.
</p><p>
Some proposals name this section <em>criteria</em> (though the term is a little misleading).
</p>
        	</note>
        <section id='template-meritocracy'><title>Meritocracy</title>
        	<note>
	     <p>
Apache is a 
<a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy'>meritocracy</a>. 
		</p><p>
Once a developer has submitted enough good patches then it should be 
natural that they are elected to committer. It should be natural that active committers are elected 
to the project management committee (PMC). 
		</p>
		<p>
This process of renewal is vital to the long term health of Apache projects.  
This is the right place to demonstrate that this process is understood 
by the proposers.
        </p>
        	</note>
        <source>
Example (OFBiz):
  OFBiz was originally created by David E. Jones and Andy Zeneski in 
  May 2001. The project now has committers and users from around the 
  world. The newer committers of the project joined in subsequent
  years by initially submitting patches, then having commit privileges
  for some of the applications, and then privileges over a larger 
  range of applications...

Example (Beehive):
  We plan to do everything possible to encourage an environment that
  supports a meritocracy. One of the lessons that the XMLBeans 
  committers have learned is that meritocracies don't just evolve 
  from good intentions; they require actively asking the community 
  for help, listing/specifying the work that needs to be done, and 
  keeping track of and encouraging members of the community who make 
  any contributions...
       </source>
        </section>
        <section id='template-community'><title>Community</title>
	        <note>
        <p>
Apache is interested only in communities. 
		</p><p>
Candidates should start with a 
community and have the potential to grow and renew this community by
attracting new users and developers. Explain how the proposal fits this vision.
        </p>
        	</note>
<source>
Example (Beehive):
  BEA has been building a community around predecessors to this 
  framework for the last two years. There is currently an active 
  newsgroup that should help us build a new community at Apache...

Example (WebWork2):
  The WebWork 2 community has a strong following with active mailing
  lists and forums...

Example (WADI):
  The need for a full service clustering and caching component in the
  open source is tremendous as its use can be applied in many areas, 
  thus providing the potential for an incredibly large community...

        <section id='template-core-developers'><title>Core Developers</title>
    	    <note>
        <p>
Apache is composed of <a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#hats'>individuals</a>. 
		</p>
		<p>
It is useful to provide a brief introduction to the developers on the 
<a href='#template-initial-committers'>initial committers</a> list.
This is best done here (and not in that section). This section may be used to discuss 
the diversity of the core development team.
        </p>
        	</note>
 <source>
Example (ServiceMix)
  The core developers are a diverse group of developers many of which 
  are already very experienced open source developers. There is at 
  least one Apache Member together with a number of other existing 
  Apache Committers along with folks from various companies. 
  http://servicemix.org/Team
 
Example (WADI) 
  WADI was founded by Jules Gosnell in 2004, it now has a strong base
  of developers from Geronimo, Castor, OpenEJB, Mojo, Jetty, 
  ActiveCluster, ActiveMQ, and ServiceMix.
</source>
        </section>
        <section id='template-alignment'><title>Alignment</title>
        	<note>
        <p>
Describe why Apache is a good match for the proposal.
An opportunity to highlight links with Apache 
<a href='http://projects.apache.org'>projects</a>
and <a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html'>development philosophy</a>.
        </p>
        	</note>
<source>
Example (Beehive):
  The initial code base is targeted to run within Tomcat, but the goal 
  is to allow the framework to run on any compliant Servlet or J2EE 
  container. The Web services component, based on JSR-181, will 
  leverage Axis. The NetUI component builds on top of Struts. The 
  underlying Controls component framework uses Velocity. There are 
  other projects that we will need to work with, such as the Portals 
  and Maven projects.

        </section>
        <section id='template-known-risks'><title>Known Risks</title>
        <note>
<p>
An exercise in self-knowledge.
Risks don't mean that a project is unacceptable. 
If they are recognized and noted then they can be addressed during incubation. 
</p>
        </note>
        <section id='template-orphaned-products'><title>Orphaned products</title>
        <note>
            <p>
A public commitment to future development. 
			</p><p>
Recruiting a diverse development community and strong user base takes time. 
Apache needs to be confident that the proposers are committed.
            </p>
        </note>
<source>
Example (Yoko):
  The contributors are leading vendors in this space. There is no risk
  of any of the usual warning signs of orphaned or abandoned code.
</source>
<br/>
<source>
Example (Ivy):
Due to its small number of committers, there is a risk of being orphaned.
The main knowledge of the codebase is still mainly owned by Xavier Hanin.
Even if Xavier has no plan to leave Ivy development, this is a problem we
are aware of and know that need to be worked on so that the project become
less dependent on an individual.
</source>
<br/>
<source>
Example (Tika):
There are a number of projects at various stages of maturity that implement 
a subset of the proposed features in Tika. For many potential users the 
existing tools are already enough, which reduces the demand for a more 
generic toolkit. This can also be seen in the slow progress of this proposal 
over the past year.

However, once the project gets started we can quickly reach the feature level 
of existing tools based on seed code from sources mentioned below. After that 
we believe to be able to quickly grow the developer and user communities based 
on the benefits of a generic toolkit over custom alternatives.
</source>
        </section>
        <section id='template-inexperience-with-open-source'><title>Inexperience with Open Source</title>
        <note>
        <p>
If the proposal is based on an existing open source project with a history of open development, 
then highlight this here.
        </p>
        <p>
If the list of <a href='#template-initial-committers'>initial committers</a> contains developers
with strong open source backgrounds then highlight this here.
        </p>
        <p>
Inexperience with open source is one reason why closed projects choose to apply for incubation.
Apache has developed over the years a store of experience in this area.
Successfully opening up a closed project means an investment of energy by all involved. 
It requires a willingness to learn and to give back to the community. If the proposal is based
around a closed project and comes with very little understand of the open source space,
then acknowledge this and demonstrate a willingness to learn.
		</p>
		</note>
<source>
Example (Cayenne):
  Cayenne was started as an open source project in 2001 and has 
  remained so for 5 years.
 </source>
 <br/>
 <source>	 
Example (Beehive):
  Many of the committers have experience working on open source 
  projects. Five of them have experience as committers on other
  Apache projects.
 </source>
 <br/>
 <source>
Example (Ivy):
  While distributed under an open source license, access to Ivy was initially
  limited with no public access to the issue tracking system or svn
  repository. While things have changed since then - the svn repository is
  publicly accessible, a JIRA instance has been setup since june 2005, many
  new features are first discussed on the forum or JIRA - experience with a
  true open source development model is currently limited.
  However, Maarten has already a good experience with true open development
  process, and bring his experience to the project.
 </source>
 <br/>
 <source>
Example (River):
  The initial committers have varying degrees of experience with open source
  projects. All have been involved with source code that has been released under
  an open source license, but there is limited experience developing code with an
  open source development process. We do not, however, expect any difficulty in
  executing under normal meritocracy rules.

        </section>
        <section id='template-homogenuous-developers'><title>Homogenous Developers</title>
            <note>
                <p>
Healthy projects need a mix of developers. Open development requires a commitment 
to encouraging a diverse mixture. This includes the art of working as part of 
a geographically scattered group in a distributed environment. 
                </p>
                <p>
Starting with a homogenous community does not prevent a project from entering incubation.
But for those projects, a commitment to creating a diverse mix of developers is useful.
Those projects who already have a mix should take this chance to highlight that they do.
                </p>
           </note>
<source>
Example (Beehive):
  The current list of committers includes developers from several 
  different companies plus many independent volunteers. The committers 
  are geographically distributed across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. 
  They are experienced with working in a distributed environment.
</source>
<br/>
<source>
Example (River)
  Since the Jini Technology Starter Kit has been mainly developed to date by Sun
  Microsystems, the vast majority of initial committers to the project are from
  Sun. Over the years, Sun has received bug fixes and enhancements from other
  developers which have been incorporated into the code. Our plan is to work with
  these other developers and add them as committers as we progress. There are
  three other initial committers (non Sun): Bill Venners, Dan Creswell, and Mark
  Brouwer. Bill is the lead of the Service UI API work, Dan has been involved with
  much Jini-based development, including an implementation of the JavaSpaces
  service called Blitz &lt;http://www.dancres.org/blitz/&gt;, and Mark is veteran of
  much Jini-based development, including commercial work at Virgil

  With only two core developers, at least they are not homogenous! Xavier and
  Maarten knew each other only due to their common interest in Ivy.

            <note>
                <p> 
A project dominated by salaried developers who are interested in the code 
only whilst they are employed to do so risks its long term health. 
				</p><p>
Apache is <a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#hats'>about</a> people, 
not corporations. We hope that developers continue to be involved with Apache 
no matter who their current employer happens to be.
                </p>
                <p>
This is a right place to indicate the initial balance between salaried developers 
and volunteers. It's also good to talk about the level of commitment of the developers.
                </p>
            </note>
<source>
Example (OpenJPA):
  Most of the developers are paid by their employer to contribute to
  this project, but given the anticipation from the Java community for 
  the a JPA implementation and the committers' sense of ownership for 
  the code, the project would continue without issue if no salaried 
  developers contributed to the project.
</source>
<br/>
<source>
Example (River):
  It is expected that Jini development will occur on both salaried time and on
  volunteer time, after hours. While there is reliance on salaried developers
  (currently from Sun, but it's expected that other company's salaried developers
  will also be involved), the Jini Community is very active and things should
  balance out fairly quickly. In the meantime, Sun will support the project in the
  future by dedicating 'work time' to Jini, so that there is a smooth transition.
</source>
<br/>
<source>
Example (Wicket):
  None of the developers rely on Wicket for consulting work, though two -
  Martijn and Eelco -  are writing Wicket In Action (publisher Manning) in
  their spare time. Most of the developers use Wicket for their day jobs,
  some for multiple projects, and will do so for a considerable while as
  their companies (specifically Topicus, Cemron and Teachscape) choose
  Wicket as their development framework of choice.

        <section id='template-other-producrs'><title>Relationships with Other Apache Products</title>  
            <note>
                <p>
Apache projects should be open to collaboration with other open source projects both 
within Apache and without. Candidates should be willing to reach outside their own little bubbles.
				</p><p>
This is a an opportunity to talk about existing links. It is also the right place to 
talk about potential future links and plans.
                </p><p>
Apache allows different projects to have competing or overlapping goals. However, this should 
mean friendly competition between codebases and cordial cooperation between communities.
                </p><p>
It is not always obvious whether a candidate is a direct competitor to an existing
project, an indirect competitor (same problem space, different ecological niche) or are just 
peers with some overlap. In the case of indirect competition, it is 
important that the abstract describes accurately the niche. Direct competitors should expect 
to be asked to summarize architectural differences and similarities to existing projects.
				</p>
			</note>
<source>
Example (OpenJPA):
  Open JPA will likely be used by Geronimo, requires some Apache 
  products (regexp, commons collections, commons lang, commons pool), 
  and supports Apache commons logging.
</source>
<br/>
<source>
Example (River)
  Currently the only tie to Apache projects is the starter kit's use 
  of the Ant build tool. There are potential future ties (http server, 
  database backend, etc)that will be explored.

        <section id='template-brand-fascination'><title>A Excessive Fascination with the Apache Brand</title>  
            <note>
                <p>
Concerns have been raised in the past that some projects appear to have been proposed 
just to generate positive publicity for the proposers. This is the right place
to convince everyone that is not the case.
				</p><p>
This is also the right place to build bridges with the 
community after past misdemeanors (for example, if any of those associated 
with the proposal have - in the past - sort to associate themselves with the Apache brand in
factually incorrect ways) and promise good conduct for the future.
                </p>
            </note>
<source>
Example (CeltiXfire):
  While we expect the Apache brand may help attract more contributors,
  our interests in starting this project is based on the factors
  mentioned in the Rationale section. However, we will be sensitive to
  inadvertent abuse of the Apache brand and will work with the 
  Incubator PMC and the PRC to ensure the brand policies are respected.
</source>
<br/>
<source>
Example (Wicket):
  The ASF has a strong brand, and that brand is in itself attractive.
  However, the developers of Wicket have been quite successful on 
  their own and could continue on that path with no problems at all. 
  We are interested in joining the ASF in order to increase our 
  contacts and visibility in the open source world. Furthermore, we 
  have been enthusiastic users of Apache from the earliest hour 
  (remember JServ anyone?), and feel honored at getting the 
  opportunity to join the club.
</source>
<br/>
<source>
Example (OpenJPA):
  We think that Open JPA is something that will benefit from wide
  collaboration, being able to build a community of developers and
  committers that outlive the founders, and that will be embraced 
  by other Apache efforts, such as the Geronimo project.

External dependencies for the initial source is important. Only some external dependencies
are allowed by Apache <a href='http://www.apache.org/legal/3party.html'>policy</a>. 
These restrictions are (to some extent) initially relaxed
for projects under incubation.

If the initial source has dependencies which would prevent graduation 
then this is the right place to indicate how these issues will be resolved.

            <note>
                <p>
The minimum required lists are private@<em>{podling}</em>.incubator.apache.org
(for confidential <a href='ppmc.html'>PPMC</a> discussions) 
and dev@<em>{podling}</em>.incubator.apache.org lists. 
<a href='ppmc.html#PPMC+Mail+List'>Note</a> 
that projects historically
misnamed the <em>private</em> list <em>pmc</em>. To 
avoid confusion over appropriate usage it was 
<a href="&root-path;/official/mailing-lists.html#july-2005">resolved</a>
that all such lists be renamed.
                </p><p>
If this project is new to open source, then starting with these minimum lists
is the best approach. 
The initial focus needs to be on recruiting new developers. 
Early adopters are potential developers.
As momentum is gained, the community may decide to create commit 
and user lists as they become necessary.
                </p><p>
Existing open source projects moving to Apache will probably want to adopt the
same mailing list set up here as they have already. However, there is no necessity
that all mailing lists be created during bootstrapping. New mailing lists can be
<a href='http://www.apache.org/dev/infra-contact'>added</a> 
by a <a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html'>VOTE</a> 
on the Podling list. 
                </p>
                <p>
By default, commits for <em>{podling}</em> will be emailed to
commits@<em>{podling}</em>.incubator.apache.org.
It is therefore recommended that this naming convention is adopted.

List of committers (stating name and an email address) used to bootstrap the community. 
Mark each which has submitted a

Existing committers should use their <code>apache.org</code> email address (since they
require only appropriate karma). Others should use the email address that is (or will be)
on the CLA. That makes it easy to match CLAs with proposed committers to the project.
            </p>
                <p>
It is a good idea to submit CLAs at the same time as the proposal. 
Nothing is lost by having a CLA on file at Apache

Little bit of a controversial 
<a href='http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/200608.mbox/%3c5c902b9e0608071114i4a63ed67r505691b8d53ce31@mail.gmail.com%3e'>subject</a>.
Committers at Apache are <a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#hats'>individuals</a>
and work here on their own behalf. They are judged on their merits not their
affiliations. However, in the spirit of full disclosure, it is useful for
any current affiliations which may effect the perceived independence of the initial committers to be 
listed openly at the start.
                </p><p>
For example, those in salaried positions whose job is to work on the
project should list their affiliation. Having this list helps to judge how
much diversity exists in the initial list and so how much work there is to
do.
                </p>
                <p>
This is best done in a separate section away from the committers
list.
                </p>
                <p>
Only the affiliations of committers on the initial bootstrap list 
are relevant. These committers have not been added by the usual 
<a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy'>meritocratic process</a>. 
It is strongly recommended that the once a project is
bootstrapped, developers are judged by their contributions and not by their
background. This list should not be maintained after the bootstrap has been completed.
